# Hosting a Zoom meeting securely

Please contact your IT support team or Zoom administrator if you have any questions or comments.

Follow this guidance as well as any other guidance from your IT department, if you are responsible for setting up, hosting and participating in meetings using the [Zoom video conference service](https://zoom.us/).

The Government Digital Service (GDS) has developed this guidance based on the NCSC [Video conferencing services: using them securely](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/video-conferencing-services-using-them-securely). It provides recommended steps for setting up and hosting meetings to reduce the risks of unauthorised access to Zoom meeting sessions. It also provides guidance for Zoom meeting participants to protect their privacy.  
  
  
## Preventing unauthorised users from joining your Zoom meeting

To help prevent unauthorised access issues like ‘[Zoom bombing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoombombing)’ when hosting a meeting you should:

-   [use a waiting room](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/360022174112-Using-a-Waiting-Room-with-Zoom-Rooms)
-   protect every meeting with a passcode
-   make sure the passcode is shared through email and not on the calendar invite
-   keep Personal Meeting IDs (PMIs) private
-   avoid sharing conference details and links on social media  
-   check meeting invitations are only sent to those who are invited   
-   check that only verified people ask to join or have joined a meeting  
-   make sure all participants use their real names or applicable role  
-   monitor attendance throughout the meeting   
-   lock the meeting if no other participants are expected to join  
-   send participants back to the waiting room if identity concerns arise during the meeting

##   Protecting your Zoom accounts and sensitive information

To help protect Zoom accounts and sensitive information you should:  

-   [use a strong and separate password](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/collection/top-tips-for-staying-secure-online/use-a-strong-and-separate-password-for-email) for Zoom accounts 
-   enable [2 Factor Authentication](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/360038247071-Setting-up-and-using-two-factor-authentication) for your Zoom accounts
-   not share emails or open documents with your audience when screen sharing

## Hosting a Zoom meeting

As a Zoom meeting host, you should:  
  
-   use a centrally managed Zoom account issued by your organisation
-   always use the Zoom.us web client and not the Zoom desktop client application
-   not record Zoom meetings by default
-   never host a government meeting from an account not managed by your organisation
-   tailor your content to attendees, who might not have non-disclosure agreements and could make information public
-   stop any discussions that may contain information that is sensitive, which is to say conversations that would have damaging consequences for individuals, an organisation, or government generally, if released to the public  

## Scheduling a Zoom meeting  
  
When [scheduling a meeting](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/201362413-How-Do-I-Schedule-Meetings-) you should make sure it has:  
  
-   a title
-   a description
-   date and time - remember that Zoom displays the date in the US format by default (month-date-year)
-   a waiting room so the host can admit them into meetings
-   a passcode that is not in the calendar invite but that you share by email or another secure messaging platform
