# Joining Zoom meetings securely  
  
## Joining a Zoom meeting with a computer

When joining a [Zoom meeting from a desktop](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/sections/200305583-Desktop) or [joining from a mobile device](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/sections/200305413-Mobile) you should:

-   use your name or role, not your e-mail address or any other identifying information malicious actors might use
-   remain on mute when not speaking - this option is in the bottom left hand corner
-   avoid sharing conference details and links on social media
-   make sure you are not in a public place when joining a meeting
-   flag any identity concerns you may have to the host
-   check you have enabled 'mute my mic when joining a meeting' and periodically [manage unmute pre-approved consent](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/203435537-Muting-and-unmuting-participants-in-a-meeting#h_01EGPFX59T8VBGBQA3VF6Z23FN) to avoid your microphone being on, or being turned on by a host, when it should be off or muted
-   [use a strong and separate password](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/collection/top-tips-for-staying-secure-online/use-a-strong-and-separate-password-for-email) for Zoom accounts, if needed

## Joining a Zoom meeting with a telephone

You can [join a Zoom meeting by phone](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/201362663-Joining-a-Meeting-by-Phone) if you cannot access it from your computer.  
  

1. The meeting host should provide you with a local number to call (such as an 0800 or 020 number) to use through the meeting invitation. Check the [full list of Zoom dial-in numbers](https://zoom.us/zoomconference).

2. When joining by phone, youâ€™ll be prompted to enter the Meeting ID. This is a 9, 10, or 11 digit ID provided to you by the host, followed by #. If you cannot find the Meeting ID, contact the meeting organiser. You might also be prompted for a passcode which you should enter. If you do not know the passcode, you should ask the meeting organiser for it.

## Set up a test call on Zoom

You can join a [test Zoom meeting](http://zoom.us/test) to familiarise yourself with Zoom and [test your computer audio and video](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/201362283-Testing-computer-or-device-audio). While in a Zoom meeting, you can select your Microphone and Speaker by selecting the up arrow between the Mute and Start Video options.
