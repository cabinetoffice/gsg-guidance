# Technical Documentation

This project uses the [Tech Docs Template][template], which is a [Middleman template][mmt] that you can use to build technical documentation using a GOV.UK style.

You’re welcome to use the template even if your service isn’t considered part of GOV.UK, but your site or service must not:

- identify itself as being part of GOV.UK
- use the crown or GOV.UK logotype in the header
- use the GDS Transport typeface
- suggest that it’s an official UK government website if it’s not

👉 To find out more about setting up and managing content for a website using this template, see the [Tech Docs Template documentation][tdt-docs].
